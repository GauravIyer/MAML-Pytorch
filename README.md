# MAML-Pytorch
This is an easy-to-read and basic implementation of some of the supervised tasks in the paper titled "Model Agnostic Meta Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks" by Chelsea Finn et al. using PyTorch.

Experiment 1: Training a regression model on a sinusoidal function using MAML, and testing it on a new sinusoidal function, given a small number of samples of the new function.

Experiment 2: Training a Convolutional Neural Network on the Omniglot dataset to perform few shot classification. Evaluation is done using N way K shot classification.

As of now, this is merely an implementation of the experiments in the original paper, and not a replication of results.
